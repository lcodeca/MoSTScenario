This project is licensed under the terms of the GPLv3 license.

MoST Scenario is meant to be used with SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility).

* The master is tested with the development version of [SUMO](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo)
* The released versions have been tested with [SUMO 1.14.0](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/tree/v1_14_0)
* In case there are problems with multi-threading, check that [Issue #4518](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/issues/4518) has been solved in your target version.

Please refer to the [SUMO wiki](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki) for further information on the simulator itself.
